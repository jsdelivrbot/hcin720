# auto-light-case

This was designed using [BoxMaker](http://boxmaker.connectionlab.org/), this was a starting point for the final version of the case, which features some added functionality in order to expose interaction elements and sensors. This is a basic image of the parts:

# Part descriptions and requirements

* All the parts (except `part 4`) have to be cut out of a 0.1in thick material.
* `part 4` has to be cut out of a 0.2in (or greater) thick material. Alternatively it is cut twice so both can be glued together.
* `part 1` features a rectangular hole for the proximity sensor, a small circular hole for the LED and a big circular hole for the button.
* `part 2` features a small circular hole for the photoresistor.
* `part 3` features a hanger so that the case can be nailed on the wall.

* An alternative to the laser-cut button can be 3d printed using [buttonMM.gcode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonyjmnz/hcin720/master/ia3/buttonMM.gcode)
* The button acts as an extension to the button in the circuit board.
